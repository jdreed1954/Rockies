## Week #26

This is the last "regular season newsletter."  The Rockies finished their regular season on Sunday, October 1.  They were able to hold on to their bid for the second wild-card place in the National League.  The Brewers finished just one game shy of the Rockies with 86 games versus the Rockies 87.  

The Rockies will play a one-game playoff against the Arizona Diamondback in Phoenix, Arizona this **Wednesday at 6:00 PM MDT**

Assuming the Rockies prevail against the Diamondbacks, the next step will be to play a best-of-five series against the Los Angeles Dodgers starting on **Friday, October 6, Dodgers Stadium 10:31 PM ET.**

# Colorado Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed in green (above the zero) and losses in red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.  

```{r GBG17}
GBG17 <- suppressWarnings(getRockiesGBG(2017))

# Calculate Cumulative Wins and Losses
GBG17 <- GBG17 %>%  
  mutate(WinG = ifelse( grepl('W',GBG17$'W/L'), 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(LossG = ifelse(grepl('L',GBG17$'W/L'),1,0))
GBG17 <- GBG17 %>% mutate(C.WinG = cumsum(WinG)) %>%
      mutate(C.LossG = cumsum(LossG)) %>%

  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.

# Topics for Future Articles

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Player Value - There is much more to cover here.  Perhaps we can rank some of the past greats based on their modern day WAR rating?
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
* Are WAR ratings a good indicator of past season's playoff and World Series teams?
* A suggestion from a work colleague that we investigate what budding talent we have in the Rockies farm system.  I will look into this and see what I can find.

Let me know what you would like to see in future articles.  Send me an email at jdreed@q.com.

Yours truly,
