## Week #5

I did get some favorable feedback on the W/L Margin charts showing the game-by-game success or failure and comparison to the 2007 season.  We will incorporate that into the **Dashboards** section and continue publishing this information weekly.

On the otherhand, I will discontinue updating the Fielding statistics.  The reason being that I am still looking for an automatic way to refresh the data each week.  There appears to be a glitch in the link to this information at baseball-reference.com.  Until I get that resolved,  I will include it as a special when requested.  Don't worry Cath, Nolan is proving himself to be a consistent defensive player at third base.  

You might have noticed on the first page in addition to the picture and quote of the week, I have included a couple of summary tables showing the progress thus far this season.  If you just look at this first page, you should get a sense of the Rockies are doing.

The featured Graphics and Tables this week will address the MLB team payrolls and their steep increases over the last ten years.  Additionally, there is a breakdown of the Rockies salary budget. 

Here is a synopsis of what is included this week.

# MLB Team Payrolls 2017

```{r MLB_Sal_2007}
c.Teams <- getCurrentTeams()
Sal07 <- getSalaries(2007) %>%
  mutate(Pay07 = Total.Payroll, Average = Pay07/Roster) %>%
  filter(Team != "Montreal Expos") %>% select(c(1,2,3,10,11))
for (i in 1:nrow(Sal07)){
  Sal07$Tm[i] <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team == Sal07$Team[i])$Team.Abr
}
Tot07Payroll <- sum(as.double(Sal07$Pay07))
ColPay07 <- filter(Sal07, Tm == "COL")$Pay07
```



```{r MLB_Sal_2017, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Sal17 <- getSalaries(2017) %>%
  mutate(Pay17 = Total.Payroll, Average = Pay17/Roster) %>%
  select(c(1,2,3,10,11)) 
Sal17$Tm <- ""
for (i in 1:nrow(Sal17)){
  Sal17$Tm[i] <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team == Sal17$Team[i])$Team.Abr
}
Tot17Payroll <- sum(as.double(Sal17$Pay17))
ColPay17 <-  filter(Sal17, Tm == "COL")$Pay17

CAGR17 <-  (Tot17Payroll/Tot07Payroll)^(1/10) - 1

```


The total 2007 MLB Payroll was `r sprintf("$%12.2f Billion",Tot07Payroll/1000/1000/1000)`.
The total 2017 MLB Payroll is `r sprintf("$%12.2f Billion",Tot17Payroll/1000/1000/1000)`.

This is a big increase between 2007 this season.  How does one express this increase in terms of the total growth over that time.  One way that investors use is to express the change as a compound annual growth rate.



```{r Combine17_and_07}
S17 <- select(Sal17, -c(1,2,3,5))
S17 <- rename(S17,Payroll = Pay17)
S07 <- select(Sal07, -c(1,2,3,5))
S07 <- rename(S07,Payroll = Pay07)
S17$Year <- 2017
S07$Year <- 2007

S.Both <- rbind(S17,S07)
S.Both[3] <- lapply(S.Both[3], factor)

ggplot(S.Both, aes(x = reorder(Tm, -Payroll), y = Payroll, fill = Year, or)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2", direction = 1) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", colour = "black",stat = "identity") +   
  xlab("Team") + 
  ylab("MLB Payroll") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous("MLB Team Payrolls", 
      breaks = c(0.0, 5.0e+07, 1.0e+08, 1.5e+08,2.0e+08, 2.5e+08),
      labels = c("0", "$50M", "$100M", "$150M", "$200M", "$250M"))

```

Colorado ranks 16th out of 30 with a total payroll of `r sprintf("$%6.2f Million",ColPay17/1000/1000)` this season (2017).  The Rockies payroll in 2007 was `r sprintf("$%6.2f Million",ColPay07/1000/1000)`.  This represents a CAGR of `r sprintf("%6.2f percent",((ColPay17/ColPay07)^(1/10) - 1) * 100)`. This outpaces the MLB as a whole but how does it compare to the rest of the league?

\newpage

**Compound annual growth rate**(CAGR) is a measure of growth applied to investment and funding matters.  Note to all of you who consider yourselves formula-phobes, this is a very useful formula.  You can apply this to your investments, your fantasy baseball winnings and other money, time-sensitive investments.  The formula for CAGR is:


$$CAGR = \left(\frac{End Value}{Beginning Value}\right)^\frac{1}{Years} - 1$$

```{r CAGR_Table}
# Build a table of Team, Payroll-2007, Payroll-2017 and CAGR
c.Teams <- getCurrentTeams()

CAGR <- tibble(Team = Sal17$Team, Tm = Sal17$Tm, Pay17 = Sal17$Pay17, Pay07 = 0 )
for (i in 1:nrow(CAGR)) {
  CAGR$League[i] <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team.Abr == CAGR$Tm[i])$League
  
  CAGR$Division[i] <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team.Abr == CAGR$Tm[i])$Division
  CAGR$LgDiv[i] <- paste(CAGR$League[i], CAGR$Division[i], sep = " ")
}
for (i in 1:nrow(Sal07)){
  CAGR$Pay07[i] <- filter(Sal07, Sal17$Tm[i] == Sal07$Tm)$Pay07
}

CAGR$CAGR <- ((CAGR$Pay17/CAGR$Pay07)^(1/10) - 1) * 100
AvgCAGR <-  mean(CAGR$CAGR)
ggplot(CAGR, aes(x = reorder(Tm, CAGR), y = CAGR, fill = LgDiv)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2", direction = 1) + 
  xlab("Team") + 
  ylab("Team CAGR") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=AvgCAGR), color = "#AA0000") +
  labs(x = "Team", title = "MLB Payroll Compound Annual Growth Rate (2007 - 2017)")

```

The average team CAGR for payroll between 2007 and 2017 is `r sprintf("%6.2f percent",AvgCAGR)`.  The graph above shows that the Kansas City Royals, San Francisco Giants and the Washington Nationals have made the largest investment in payrolls over the past decade.  Of late, it appears the Nationals are getting real returns in their number of wins thus far this season.

In terms of overall investment in payroll, the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees are the top three.

  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust =1)) +
  labs(x = "Player", title = "Rockies 2017 Player Salaries")


```

The striking feature of the graph above is the three-tier nature of the salary structure.  New players receive, what would be considered a very lucrative salary of more than $500,000 per year.  The next tier consists of about 12 players making between $1M and $7M per year. Then there are the very-highly paid superstars, Arenado at $11,750,000 and Carlos Gonzalez brings in a whopping $20,428,571!  If we look deeper into this, we would find the economic reasonong that drive teams to this stratified pay structure.  Not least of the factors is salary arbitration.  A player is eligible in particular situations for arbitration.  The minimum salary for a MLB player in 2017 is set by MLB and is $535,000 per year.

# Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed as green (above the zero) and losses as red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.

The Rockies current record is `r WINS` Wins and `r LOSSES` Losses.  So far, the Rockies have scored `r TotalR` runs and have had `r TotalRA` runs scored against them.

  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Player Value - I am personally just getting familiar with this concept.  Work In Progress (WIP)
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
