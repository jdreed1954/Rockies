## The Baseball Codes

The week the Baseball Codes story was originally posted by Jason Turbow Wed 5/9/2018 1:05 PM in his blog.  It concerns the rule regarding right of way at the plate when a base runner approaches home plate with the intention of scoring.

### Collision Course: The State Of Baseball, 2018 by Jason Turbow 

This is a story about baseball’s rulebook, and also about baseball’s unwritten rulebook. One, it turns out, feeds the other.
Yesterday, Marlins left fielder Derek Dietrich, racing home on a single, was easily beaten by the throw from Cubs right fielder Ben Zobrist. With his only hope at scoring being to dislodge the ball from the catcher, Dietrich plowed into Victor Caratini, just as generations before him have done.

Actually, it was a fair step milder than in previous generations, the collision being mostly arms, not even forceful enough to knock Caratini from his feet. Still, this is the no-contact era of major league baseball, a place where, following Scott Cousins’ takeout of Buster Posey back in 2011, the target on catchers’ backs was institutionally removed. This is a time in which a late slide from Tyler Austin—a slide that once wouldn’t have so much as raised an eyebrow in the opposing dugout—led to fisticuffs in New York.

So, when Dietrich took liberties with Caratini, Caratini responded in kind. The dugouts quickly emptied, and though the most significant moment of the resulting skirmish involved Kris Bryant tickling former teammate Starlin Castro, the event is worthy of exploration.

Cubs and Marlins benches clear after Derek Dietrich barrels into Victor Caratini at home.

No punches thrown. 

MLB rule 6.01(i)(1) instructs that any catcher ceding the baseline—standing in front of the plate and relying on a swipe tag to make the putout—is in safe waters: “A runner attempting to score may not deviate from his direct pathway to the plate in order to initiate contact with the catcher (or other player covering home plate), or otherwise initiate an avoidable collision.”

Dietrich did not deviate from his pathway because he did not have to: Caratini was planted firmly atop the line while awaiting the throw—going firmly against Rule 6.01(i)(2), which clarifies that “unless the catcher is in possession of the ball, the catcher cannot block the pathway of the runner as he is attempting to score.”

In this case, it appeared to be unwitting: Upon receiving the ball, Caratini turned to make the requisite swipe tag before realizing that he had overshot his positioning and was reaching into foul territory, away from the plate. He quickly drew his glove back into the runner.

It left Dietrich little choice about contact. The runner’s ensuing shove was purely elective, of course, though it was a far cry from the devastation possible had he opted to lower his shoulder. Dietrich even tried to make nice by tipping his cap to the catcher before Caratini got into his face.

We’re left with this: Victor Caratini is 24 years old and was playing in his 51st big league game. Posey-era rules are all he's ever known. With little basis from which to understand the rationality of Dietrich’s decision, the catcher reacted angrily at being shoved, and a play that should barely have registered soon bordered on fisticuffs.

The sport’s unwritten rules can be seen in similar light. Take the aforementioned Yankees-Red Sox brawl back in April. On one hand, the Red Sox were overly sensitive about a slide that a generation earlier wouldn’t have drawn much notice. On the other, the slide was clearly outside of baseball’s recently established parameters, and Austin should have been prepared for the response that he received.

Ultimately, neither side had much clue about how to handle what was, before now, a fairly standard baseball situation, and things ended badly. They ended badly because many players no longer understand the intentions behind much of the Code, and react instinctively rather than rationally. It’s what enables sensitivity about the personal nature of an action that is not at all personal.

These are the unintended consequences of the sanitation of the sport. There are clear benefits—fewer collision-based injuries and a decline in retaliatory beanballs—but there are also growing pains. Yesterday's collision was only one of them, with more certain to follow.
 
### Colorado Connection - What is Tim Tebow doing these days?

Ever the competitor, Tim Tebow has been toiling in the Mets farm  system for the last couple of years.  The comments have been that the lefty Tebow is not that outstanding in America's past time.  Thing is, he brings in the crowds.  Tebow played for the Class A Columbia team in 2017.  He hit .226 with eight homers, 52 RBIs, 24 doubles and a .309 on-base percentage (OBP).

This year Tebow has moved up to Double A ball and is playing for the **Binghamton Rumble Ponies**.  He hit a three-run homer in his debut at-bat for the Double A Rumble Ponies.  To his deniers, yes, he is thirty years old and no, he hasn't played baseball in a while, but he has an amazing attitude and the fans like to come out to see the lefty play.

## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed in green (above the zero) and losses in red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.  

```{r GBG18}
GBG18 <- suppressWarnings(getRockiesGBG(2018))

# Calculate Cumulative Wins and Losses
GBG18 <- GBG18 %>%  
  mutate(WinG = ifelse( grepl('W',GBG18$'W/L'), 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(LossG = ifelse(grepl('L',GBG18$'W/L'),1,0))
GBG18 <- GBG18 %>% mutate(C.WinG = cumsum(WinG)) %>%
      mutate(C.LossG = cumsum(LossG)) %>%
      mutate(Date.Full = as.Date(paste(trimws(GBG18$Date), ", 2018", sep =""), 
                                 format ="%B %d, %Y"))
```

            DN = GBG18$`D/N`, HA = GBG18$`H/A`, WLsign = " ")
D <- D %>% separate(Date, into = c("Month", "Day"), sep =" ")

D$WLsign <-  ifelse(D$WLMargin < 0, "Loss", "Win")


D$Month <- match(tolower(D$Month), tolower(month.abb))

The Rockies current record is `r Current$Wins` Wins and `r Current$Losses` Losses.  So far, the Rockies have scored `r TotalR` runs and have had `r TotalRA` runs scored against them.

## Pythagorean Win-Loss Theorem
$$ predicted W\% = \frac{R^k}{R^k+RA^k}   $$
```{r PredWin, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Build Table of Pythagorean Win Predictions for 2017
PredictedWins <- tibble(
  `Wins (k=1.81)` = round(TotalR^1.81/(TotalR^1.81+TotalRA^1.81)*162),
  `Wins (k=1.83)` = round(TotalR^1.83/(TotalR^1.83+TotalRA^1.83)*162),
  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.
