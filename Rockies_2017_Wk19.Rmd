## Week #19

The Rockies are still in second place in their division but losing ground to the LA lads. The Colorado gang won just one game of six this week.  Hang in their Rox fans, it could be a rocky October. 

Chad Bettis returned to active duty last Monday, taking part in some rehab starts at Coors Field against his team mates.  The Rockies are being careful to bring back their prized right hander in a slow and deliberate manner.  He was sent to Connecticut by the Rox front office on Thursday to pitch a couple  innings for the Double A Hartford Yard Goats against the Yankees' Double A affiliate, the Trenton Thunder.  Chad is expected to return to the Rockies rotation on Monday, August 14th.

This weeks' featured article is bound to disappoint some of you.  Again, I return to the WAR ratings of position players and pitchers.  This time though, the top twenty for each will be displayed.  Before you skip ahead to see whether or not your favorite player is ranked, take a deep breath.  WAR or Wins Above Replacement is an ongoing quest to find the perfect metric by which to measure the worth of a baseball player compared to his fellow players, present and past.  Baseball-Reference and others have refined WAR over several years.

If you would like to see an in-depth explanation and the history of WAR, see the following URL: https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/war_explained.shtml.

## Top Twenty MLB Pitchers of All Time 

The tables below show the top pitchers of all time.  As before, these WAR values are from Baseball-Reference.com.


```{r TopBatters}

# Colorado Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed in green (above the zero) and losses in red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.  

```{r GBG17}
GBG17 <- suppressWarnings(getRockiesGBG(2017))

# Calculate Cumulative Wins and Losses
GBG17 <- GBG17 %>%  
  mutate(WinG = ifelse( grepl('W',GBG17$'W/L'), 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(LossG = ifelse(grepl('L',GBG17$'W/L'),1,0))
GBG17 <- GBG17 %>% mutate(C.WinG = cumsum(WinG)) %>%
      mutate(C.LossG = cumsum(LossG)) %>%
      mutate(Date.Full = as.Date(paste(trimws(GBG17$Date), ", 2017", sep =""), 
                                 format ="%B %d, %Y"))
```

## Top Twelve Rockies Players as Measured by WAR

Following is a table of the top twelve Colorado Rockies players as measured by the most recent WAR assessment for pitchers and position players.  Week after week Nolan Arenado is at the top of this list.  You may be surprised by some of the others on the list.

The Rockies current record is `r Current$Wins` Wins and `r Current$Losses` Losses.  So far, the Rockies have scored `r TotalR` runs and have had `r TotalRA` runs scored against them.

## Pythagorean Win-Loss Theorem
$$ predicted W\% = \frac{R^k}{R^k+RA^k}   $$
```{r PredWin, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Build Table of Pythagorean Win Predictions for 2017
PredictedWins <- tibble(
  `Wins (k=1.81)` = round(TotalR^1.81/(TotalR^1.81+TotalRA^1.81)*162),
  `Wins (k=1.83)` = round(TotalR^1.83/(TotalR^1.83+TotalRA^1.83)*162),
  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.

# Topics for Future Articles

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Player Value - There is much more to cover here.  Perhaps we can rank some of the past greats based on their modern day WAR rating?
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
* Are WAR ratings a good indicator of past season's playoff and World Series teams?
* A suggestion from a work colleague that we investigate what budding talent we have in the Rockies farm system.  I will look into this and see what I can find.

Let me know what you would like to see in future articles.  Send me an email at jdreed@q.com.

Yours truly,
