## Week #8

The Rockies have had a good week, winning four in a row and five of the last seven, since May 21.  Cargo is showing signs of returning to form.  To date (May 29, 2017), Cargo has OBP, SLG and OPS values of .308, .375 and .683, respectively.  This is better than the performance reported for the same date in 2016: .298, .337 and .636.  Things are moving in the right direction for Cargo.  Trevor Story returned to the lineup on Wednesday, May 24, 2017.

## Career Statistics Comparison:  Barry Bonds and Hank Aaron

### Barry Lamar Bonds

```{r , fig.height=4.0, fig.cap="Barry Bonds played in MLB 1986 to 2007."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Barry_Bonds.jpg")
```

Barry Lamar Bonds was born on July 24, 1964 in Riverside, California.  His father, Bobby Bonds, is a formr major league baseball player. Bobby played fourteen years in the majors with various teams in both the American and National leagues.  His longest stint was with the San Francisco Giants (1967-74).

Barry Bonds was a multi-sport athelete in high scool, playing baseball, basketball and football.  He batted .467 his senior year and was named prep All-American. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds#Early_life).

Bonds was drafted by the San Francisco Giants but he and the franchise could not come to an amicable agreement on salary.  Bonds' minimum to go pro was $75,000.  The Giants highest offer was $70,000.  So, he decided to go college.

Bonds attended Arizon State University. After college, the Pittsbugh Pirates drafted Bonds.  He played for the Pirates from 1986 until 1992.  As a free agent in 1993, Bonds signed with the San Francisco Giants for whom he played for the remainder of his career (1993-2007).

In this article we will focus on Barry Bonds and his phenomenal baseball career.  Among other records, Bonds is the MLB leader in the most career home runs, 762.  He holds the single season record for the most home runs, 73, set in 2001. It is clear that Bonds was an extrodinary baseball player on both offense and defense.  


To show how extraordinary Bonds really was, it is instructive to compare Bonds with another baseball great. For this comparison, we will use one of the all-time great hitter, Hank Aaron.

Henry Louis "Hank" Aaron was born February 5, 1934.  He spent much of his young life in and around Mobile, Alabama.  Hank Aaron played for twenty-three seasons in MLB, twenty-one seasons for the Atlanta Braves (NL) and two years for the Milwaukee Brewers (AL).  Aaron holds many MLB records:
  
  * Most seasons as an All-Star and most All-Star Games (25)
  * Most career RBIs (2,297)
  * Extra-base hits (1,477)
  * Total bases (6,856)

Below is a scatter plot of Barry's batting average for each season of his career.  The size of the sample points corresponds to his OPS for that season.  OPS is the sum of his On base Percentage (OBP) and his Slugging score (SLG).

Note the unique shape of the curve as he begins career reaches a peak in his late twenties, plateaus for several years with a significant dip when he 34 years old.  Then, a miraculous surge in both his batting average as well his OPS performance starting at age 35.

At 36 (2001) he turns in his most productive season, hitting a record 73 home runs, batting .328, OBP of .863 and SLG of .411.  His OPS was 1.274.  The year after, Bonds hit a career high of .370.

Bonds played until 2007, age 42.  His batting average had fallen to .276 but achieved a very respectable .963 OPS.

To conclude, both the shape of the overall batting average curve as well as the magnitude of the surge late in Bonds' career are **atypical.**  I leave it up the reader to interpret the cause and significance of these data.


```{r BondsAvg, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Barry Bonds - Batting Average by Year" }
btitle <- paste("Barry Bonds","Batting Average by Year", sep=" ")
ggplot() + 
     geom_point(data = PlayerStats, aes(Age,H/AB*1000, size = OPS)) + 
     geom_smooth(data = PlayerStats, aes(Age, H/AB*1000), fill = "blue", colour = "darkblue") +
     geom_hline(yintercept=300) +
     ggtitle(btitle) + labs(x = "Age", y = "Batting Average")
```

# Hank Aaron

Hank Aaron, active in MLB 1954 to 1976, was not a contemporary of Barry Bonds, but his profile is one of the prototypical great hitter.  He grew to his peak in his late twenties and then experienced a gradual decline over his remaining years in baseball.  In the book _Analyzing Baseball Data with R_ by Max Marchi and Jim Albert, the authors characterize this a "career trajectory" and model it as a quadratic equation of the form:

$$A + B(Age-30) + C(Age-30)^{2}$$
The values of $A$, $B$ and $C$ are chosen to best fit the model to the players batting performance.


```{r HankAvg, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Hank Aaron - Batting Average by Year"}
btitle <- paste("Hank Aaron","Batting Average by Year", sep=" ")
ggplot() + 
     geom_point(data = HankStats, aes(Age,H/AB*1000,size = OPS)) + 
     geom_smooth(data = HankStats, aes(Age, H/AB*1000), fill = "red", colour = "darkred") + 
     geom_hline(yintercept=300) +
     ggtitle(btitle) + labs(x = "Age", y = "Batting Average")
```

```{r OPS_Models, echo=FALSE}
# Use Lifetime statistics to produce model of OPS ~ Age
Bonds <- PlayerStats # from above
Aaron <- HankStats   # from above

# Model Aaron and Bonds career OPS performance
F1 <- fit.model(Aaron)
F2 <- fit.model(Bonds)

# Let's Make a Data Table of the model results.
a_xmin <- min(Aaron$Age); a_xmax <- max(Aaron$Age)
b_xmin <- min(Bonds$Age); b_xmax <- max(Bonds$Age)

a_predicted <- data.frame(Age = seq(a_xmin, a_xmax, length.out=100))
b_predicted <- data.frame(Age = seq(b_xmin, b_xmax, length.out=100))

a_predicted$OPS <- predict(F1$fit,a_predicted)
b_predicted$OPS <- predict(F2$fit,b_predicted)

```

\newpage

## Marchi & Albert Career Trajectory Models for Aaron and Bonds


As discussed above, Marchi and Albert describe a player's offensive career trajectory as a quadratic curve rising in the first part of the player's career.  Reaching an apogee at about age thirty, the usual performance curve gradually declines.  The graph below shows two very different players.  While Hank Aaron's trajectory is more typical, Barry Bonds'  generally improves over his entire career.  Examining the graph below, if you mentally remove the data points from age 35-38, Bonds trajectory would be more like Aaron's.

```{r PlotOPS, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Bonds and Aaron Trajectory Models with OPS Values by Age."}
# Let's plot the OPS data points plus the model trace 
ggplot(Bonds, aes(Age, OPS)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = "Bonds", size = HR)) +
  geom_line(data = b_predicted, aes(color = "Bonds")) +
  geom_point(data = Aaron, aes(Age, OPS, color = "Aaron", size = HR)) +
  geom_line(data = a_predicted, aes(color = "Aaron")) +
  ggtitle("Hank Aaron & Barry Bonds OPS Models") + 
  labs(x = "Age", y = "OPS")
  
```



\newpage

Again, notice the general shape of Hank Aaron's cumulative batting average; it increases until about age 30 years and then gradually decreases.  On the other hand, Bonds curve increases throughout his career, taking a maked improveed rate of change at age 35 years.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Hank Aaron & Barry Bonds  - Lifetime Cumulative Batting Averages"}

ggplot(data = PlayerStats, aes(Age,cumAvg*1000, color = "Bonds")) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = OPS)) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_point(data = HankStats, aes(Age, cumAvg * 1000, color = "Aaron", size = OPS)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = HankStats) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=300) +
  ggtitle("Hank Aaron & Barry Bonds Career Cumulative Batting Average") + 
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Cumulative Batting Average")
```

\newpage

## Aaron & Bonds Cumulative Home Run Production

Hank Aaron does exceed Barry Bonds in cumulative home runs for most of his career when you look at their respcetive careers by age.  Bonds begins to close the gap when he reaches the age of 35.  He surpasses Aaron in total number of home runs in his last season, age 42.  Bonds, of course, still holds the career home run record of 762.  Before Bonds, Hank Aaron held the home run record for 33 years.  The only other player to hit over 700 home runs is Babe Ruth whose total is 714.  Ruth's record stood for 34 years.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Aaron & Bonds Cumulative Home Run Production"}

PlayerStats <- PlayerStats %>% mutate(Cum.HR = cumsum(HR))
ggplot(data = PlayerStats, aes(Age,Cum.HR, color = "Bonds")) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = OPS)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(data = HankStats, aes(Age,Cum.HR, color = "Aaron", size = OPS)) +
  geom_line(data = HankStats) +
  ggtitle("Cumulative Home Run Production") + 
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Cumulative Home Runs")
```

# Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed as green (above the zero) and losses as red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.

# Topics for Future Articles

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Player Value - I am personally just getting familiar with this concept.  Work In Progress (WIP)
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
* A suggestion from a work colleague that we investigate what budding talent we have in the Rockies farm system.  I will look into this and see what I can find.

Let me know what you would like to see in future articles.  Send me email at jdreed@q.com.
