## Week #7

The Rockies are still on top of the National League this week, edging out the Nationals with a higher winning percentage.  Trevor Story was put on the disabled list on Monday (May 15) with a strained left shoulder.  He **may** be activated before the end of May.

Here is a synopsis of what is included this week.

# Solution to Logarithm Quiz

To review the context of the question, we presented a graph of points, one per season Cargo has played in MLB.  The values plotted are the $log_{10}$ of the **real** statistic.

Solve for $x$ in the following equation to get the real value of a statistic for Cargo's **2017 season.**
$$log_{10}(x) = 7.301030$$
Simplifying this equation ($x$ by itself on the left-hand side), we get: $$x_{2017} = 10^{7.301030}$$
Solve for $x$ in this equation to get the value of this unknown statistic for Cargo's **2009 season.**
$$log_{10}(x) = 5.605305$$
Again, simplifying, as above, we get: $$x_{2009} = 10^{5.605305}$$



One **does not** require a scientific calculator to compute these values.  Google will do it for you!  Simply paste this string into the search bar for Google.com to get the value for $x_{2009}$:

              10^5.605305

And for $x_{2017}$, paste this string into Google.com:

              10^7.301030


The rounded values returned by Google are **403,000** and **20,000,000.**  These represent the **salary** Cargo received or will receive for **2009** and **2017**, respectively.

# Featured Graphics

## Carlos Gonzalez OPS Performance, historical perspective.

If you have been following the sports press this season, you know there is some concern regarding Cargo's offensive production.  He has performed well on the field and has been a leader both in the dugout and on the field.  In the past, his biggest value to the team has been his performance at the plate.  Some have posited that he is just having a slow start; that he starts slow and finishes strong.

For this analysis we will use OPS (Onbase Plus Slugging) as a measure of Cargo's season-to-season performance.

The following table shows Cargo's OPS.  Note, the OPS value for 2017 is for Cargo's to-date performance this season. To date, Cargo has played in most of the `r WINS + LOSSES` games in the current season.  This represents `r format(((WINS+LOSSES) / 162) * 100, digits = 2)` percent of the season's 162 games.

```{r}
# Workflow - save data as csv files:
cg_path <-"./data/Carlos-Gonzalez_batting.xlsx"
cg_sheets <- excel_sheets(cg_path)
cg_all <- tibble()
cg_season <- tibble()
for (i in cg_sheets){
  file <-  paste("./data/cg_", i,".csv", sep = "")
  cg_sheet <- cg_path %>% read_excel(sheet = i) %>% write_csv(file)
  cg_sheet$Year <- year(ymd(cg_sheet$Date))
  cg_season <- rbind(cg_season,cg_sheet[nrow(cg_sheet),]) 
  cg_all <- rbind(cg_all, cg_sheet)
}

# Let's rearrange columns in data_frame
cg_all <- select(cg_all, Year,c(1:27)) %>%
  filter(AVG < .500)

cg_season <- select(cg_season, Year, OPS)

knitr::kable(cg_season, caption = "Carlos Gonzalez OPS by Year")
```

Cargo's OPS average through 2016 is `r format(mean(cg_season$OPS[1:9]), digits = 3)`.  His OPS measure this season is 
`r format((1-(cg_season$OPS[10]/mean(cg_season$OPS[1:9])))*100,digits=3)` percent below this average. Over twenty-five percent of the season has been played.


```{r FacetWrap_OBS, fig.height=6, fig.width=6.0, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Plots showing season-by-season OPS performance.
# Facet Wrap for Season OPS 
sp <- ggplot(cg_all, aes(as.Date(Date),OPS, group = Year)) + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", 
      date_labels="%b") +
      geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("Carlos Gonzalez OPS by Year") + xlab("Month") + ylab("OPS")

sp + facet_wrap(~Year, ncol=2,scales=("free_x")) + theme_bw()

```

The faceted graphs above illustrate the trajectory of Cargo's OPS for each of his MLB seasons.  In most seasons, Cargo has started strong and leveled out as the season has progressed.  The exceptions to this are seasons 2009, 2012 and this season.  This season has been unique for Cargo in that he has not shown anything close to his performance in previous seasons.  Let us hope he finds the combination to get back to his usual stellar form.

The plot below is another facet-type graphic showing each of Cargo's MLB career seasons.  This time we use a **violin** visualization.  The "violin" shows the distribution of his OPS performance over the season.  The bumps above or below the bulge indicate his streaks and slumps, respectively.  Study these carefully and see if you can discern how his performance varies from season to season.  How is his performance in 2017 different from all the other years?

# Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed as green (above the zero) and losses as red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.  

```{r GBG17}

The Rockies current record is `r Current$Wins` Wins and `r Current$Losses` Losses.  So far, the Rockies have scored `r TotalR` runs and have had `r TotalRA` runs scored against them.

## Pythagorean Win-Loss Theorem
$$ predicted W\% = \frac{R^k}{R^k+RA^k}   $$
```{r PredWin, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Build Table of Pythagorean Win Predictions for 2017
PredictedWins <- tibble(
  `Wins (k=1.81)` = round(TotalR^1.81/(TotalR^1.81+TotalRA^1.81)*162),
  `Wins (k=1.83)` = round(TotalR^1.83/(TotalR^1.83+TotalRA^1.83)*162),
  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.

# Topics for Future Articles

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Player Value - I am personally just getting familiar with this concept.  Work In Progress (WIP)
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
* A suggestion from a work colleague that we investigate what budding talent we have in the Rockies farm system.  I will look into this and see what I can find.

Let me know what you would like to see in future articles.  Send me email at jdreed@q.com.

Yours truly,
