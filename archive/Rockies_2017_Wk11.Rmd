## Week #12

In any season, a little rain must fall.  So it has been for the Rockies this past week.  For the fist time this season, they have lost four in a row.  Nick Groke of the Denver Post writes in a June 24, 2017 editorial regarding the Rockies reliance on a largely rookie pitching squad, 

>"But a chill has overcome the Rockies’ progress. Not because of the losses, exactly, but the potential for weariness. Are we seeing the warning signs of fatigue in pitchers playing their first big-league season?" 

Perhaps the All Star break will help the Rockies pitchers revive their fatigued arms.  The break for the Rockies starts on July 10 and ends on July 4 with the Rockies playing the New York Mets, away.

Here is a synopsis of what is included this week.

# Featured Article

## What is "Wins Above Replacement" and How is it Calculated

The Sabermetrician's Holy Grail is to develop more and better statistics to measure the effectiveness of players and teams.  The goals are to better define the essence of a winning team and define the most comprehensive metric to compare each player against all others, past and present.  

Since the early work by Bill James, there has been an evolution of metrics to measure batting, base running, fielding, and pitching.  We have moved on from just stating a ballplayer's batting average (BA) to measuring his effectiveness of getting on base (OBP) and his ability to get extra-base hits (SLG).  And, of course, we combine OBP and SLG to represent (OPS) a player's overall effectiveness as a batter.  However, this does not tell the whole story of a position-player or pitcher's effectiveness.  What's missing are measurements that take into account of his fielding or pitching.   

An attempt to take all of these factors into account has gone into the development **WAR,** Wins Above Replacement.  The basis of WAR is to estimate the number of runs contributed by a player.  This number of runs is translated into wins by roughly ten runs being equivalent to one win. 

For example, Rockies third-baseman, Nolan Arenado has a WAR rating of  3.1, which makes him the Rockies highest-rated WAR player. 

WAR is a measure of a players offensive performance (batting and base running) and defensive effectiveness in denying runs by opposing teams by fielding or pitching.

There is no agreed upon standard calculation for WAR values.  Three primary sources of WAR calculations are **Baseball Prospectus, Baseball Reference and FanGraphs.**  The Baseball Reference version of WAR is named **bWAR** or **rWAR.**  FanGraphs uses the abbreviation **fWAR** for their particular formulation of the WAR statistic.

WAR is not recognized as an official statistic by **Major League Baseball** or by the **Elias Sports Bureau.**  Although flawed and often miss-applied, WAR is the most comprehensive statistic for measuring a player's value. I consider it a work in progress.  As it is refined and standardized, it will become more commonly used and referenced.

Following is a table of Rockies players and their Baseball Reference **bWAR** values.

```{r}
Rockies_bWAR <-  tibble(Rank = c(1:12), Player = c("Nolan Arenado","Kyle Freeland", 
                     "Charlie Blackmon", "Tyler Chatwood", "Antonio Senzatela", 
                     "Greg Holland", "DJ LaMahieu", "Jeff Hoffman", "Mark Reynolds",
                     "Chris Rusin",  "Jake McGee", "German Marquez"), 
                      bWAR = c(3.1, 2.9, 2.4, 2.2, 2.2, 1.5, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2))

knitr::kable(Rockies_bWAR,caption = "Baseball Reference bWAR Values of Top Twelve Colorado Rockies Players")

# Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed in green (above the zero) and losses in red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.  

```{r GBG17}

## Pythagorean Win-Loss Theorem
$$ predicted W\% = \frac{R^k}{R^k+RA^k}   $$
```{r PredWin, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Build Table of Pythagorean Win Predictions for 2017
PredictedWins <- tibble(
  `Wins (k=1.81)` = round(TotalR^1.81/(TotalR^1.81+TotalRA^1.81)*162),
  `Wins (k=1.83)` = round(TotalR^1.83/(TotalR^1.83+TotalRA^1.83)*162),
  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.

# Topics for Future Articles

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Player Value - We finally got started on this one this week.  I will continue to explore WAR values in coming weeks.
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
* A suggestion from a work colleague that we investigate what budding talent we have in the Rockies farm system.  I will look into this and see what I can find.

Let me know what you would like to see in future articles.  Send me an email at jdreed@q.com.

Yours truly,
