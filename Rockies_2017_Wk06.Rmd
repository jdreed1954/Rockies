## Week #6

The Rockies had a better than even week since Monday, May 1 with seven wins and five losses.  The Dodgers came to town and hand us two losses before leaving.  However, by the Sunday (May 14), the Rox are still tops in their division with a 25 & 15 record.

Personally, I had a pretty busy week and weekend, so the **Featured Graphics** section will get short shrift this week.  I have been working on summarizing Carlos Gonzalez's batting performance for the years in his MLB career leading up to this season.  The premise is that Cargo takes some time each season to hit his stride and that this season is no difference.  The hope being that he will be hitting in MVP territory before the end of the year, if not sooner.  Anyway, if I get time to refine the graphics this week while in Nashville, I just might be able to include this in next week's newsletter.

For this week, I decided to appeal to your sense of wonder when you first encountered logarithms in Algebra. We present a graph of log data corresponding to a particular statistic belonging to Cargo.  Your job is to figure what the real value of Cargo's "performance" in this instance for 2009 and 2017.  Should be fun!

Here is a synopsis of what is included this week.

* **Featured Graphics**  
    + A Trip Down Mathematics Memory Lane and A Quiz 
* Colorado Rockies Dashboards
    + Rockies Win/Loss Graphs for 2017 and 2007
    + National and American League Standings
    + Game-by-Game Results of the past week.
    + **Pythagorean Theorem** prediction of the number of wins.
    + Batting Statistics
    + Pitching Statistics

Most of the source data for this article can be found at URL [http://baseball-reference.com](http://baseball-reference.com).

Let me know what other special interest statistics you might like to see.  Remember to refer to the Glossaries at the end of the document if unfamiliar with one or more of the statistic abbreviations in the tables.

# Featured Graphics

## A Trip Down Mathematics Memory Lane and A Quiz 

Do you remember taking Algebra?  I remember it as magic, linear equations, quadratic equations, polynomials, and, of course, logarithms.  Logarithms, especially were magic to me:take the logarithm of two numbers, take these new values and add them together, take the antilogarithm of the result and you got the **product** of the original two values!  Wow, multiplication by adding!  The difficulty comes when you have to look up the antilogs from tables.  We used the __CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae__.  The so called **magic** of the process wore off after performing a handful of these multiplications, looking up the antilog, interpolating between two values.  Boring, but a powerful concept, just the same.

Following is a graph of logarithmic values based on a metric for Carlos Gonzalez in last week's article.  Your mission is to identify the metric and the **real** lowest and highest value in the graph below.

```{r Quiz1, results = 'asis'}
career <- tibble(Year = c(2009:2017), 
  Salary = c(403000,406000,1428571,5000000,7500000,10500000,16000000,17000000,20000000))

career$logSalary <- log10(career$Salary)

ggplot(career,aes(x = Year, y = logSalary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2009:2017), 
      labels = c("2009", "2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017")) +
  ggtitle("Carlos Gonzalez Mystery Statistic") + xlab("Year") + ylab("Log of Something?")

```

Have you guessed what represented is here?  It is all about **antilogs.**  Read further to get more hints.

Solve for $x$ in the following equation to get the real value of a statistic for Cargo's **2017 season.**

$$log_{10}(x) = 7.301030$$
Solve for $x$ in this equation to get the value of this unknown statistic for Cargo's **2009 season.**


$$log_{10}(x) = 5.605305$$

Here is another clue:

Take the antilog (base 10) of each side, yielding, for the latter equation above:

$$x_{2009} = 10^{5.605305}$$
Likewise, the first equation resolves to:

$$x_{2017} = 10^{7.301030}$$

Send me your answers in email or printed on a crisp hundred-dollar bill.  I'll let everyone know our winners next week.  Just send your answers to jdreed@q.com.  No need to copy all!

# Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed as green (above the zero) and losses as red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.  

```{r GBG17}
GBG17 <- suppressWarnings(getRockiesGBG(2017))
```

```{r WinLossMargin17,fig.height=3.5,fig.width=6.5}

            DN = GBG17$`D/N`, HA = GBG17$`H/A`, WLsign = " ")
D <- D %>% separate(Date, into = c("Month", "Day"), sep =" ")
D[which(D$WLMargin == 0),]$WLMargin <- 0
D$WLsign <-  ifelse(D$WLMargin < 0, "Loss", "Win")


D$Month <- match(tolower(D$Month), tolower(month.abb))
D$Date <- with(D, as.Date(paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = "/")))

p1 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = Date, y = WLMargin, fill = WLsign)) +

## [American League Standings](http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/2017-standings.shtml#expanded_standings_W::none)

```{r ALStandings, results = 'asis'}

## Rockies Game-by-Game Schedule/Results

```{r GBGResults, results = 'asis'}
GBG17 <- getRockiesGBG(2017) 
GBG17 <- filter(GBG17, Win != " ")
knitr::kable(GBG17)
```
```{r Season17}
WINS <- length(grep("W",GBG17$`W/L`))
LOSSES <- length(grep("L",GBG17$`W/L`))
WPCT <- WINS/(WINS + LOSSES)
TotalR <- sum(as.integer(GBG17$R))
TotalRA <- sum(as.integer(GBG17$RA))
```

The Rockies current record is `r WINS` Wins and `r LOSSES` Losses.  So far, the Rockies have scored `r TotalR` runs and have had `r TotalRA` runs scored against them.

## Pythagorean Win-Loss Theorem
$$ predicted W\% = \frac{R^k}{R^k+RA^k}   $$
```{r PredWin, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Build Table of Pythagorean Win Predictions for 2017
PredictedWins <- tibble(
  `Wins (k=1.81)` = round(TotalR^1.81/(TotalR^1.81+TotalRA^1.81)*162),
  `Wins (k=1.83)` = round(TotalR^1.83/(TotalR^1.83+TotalRA^1.83)*162),
  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.

```{r PredWins, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(PredictedWins, caption = "Predicted Wins for Entire 2017 Season")

# Topics for Future Articles

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Analysis of Carlos Gonzalez batting trajectory year by year.  Does he always have a slow start? 
* Player Value - I am personally just getting familiar with this concept.  Work In Progress (WIP)
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
* A suggestion from a work colleague that we investigate what budding talent we have in the Rockies farm system.  I will look into this and see what I can find.

Let me know what you would like to see in future articles.  Send me email at jdreed@q.com.

Yours truly,
