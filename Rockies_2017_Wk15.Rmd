## Week #15

This being the week of the all-star break, the Rockies have only played three games since July 9 of which they are 1 and 2.

We will continue to delve into the relationship between team WAR and payroll this week.  We will develop a linear regression model.  

One of the suggestions I received this week regards our participation in the All-Star Game.  How do our Rockies' WAR ratings compare to the other players and teams.  I'll endeavor to explore that this week and have something to report next week.

Here is a synopsis of what is included in this week's newsletter.

# Featured Article

## Regression Model of WAR versus Team Payroll

Last week we presented the Team Combined WAR values (FanGraphs) and payroll for the thirty MLB teams.  The question was, "By looking at the data, can you tell if there is a relationship between the WAR ratings and payroll?"  In mathematics this sort of analysis is called linear regression.  Regression is a fancy way of saying "relationship."  In the context of our analysis, "Are payroll and WAR values related?"  Does an increase in Payroll have a positive or negative effect on the WAR value of a team?

Looking way back, can you recall the formula for a line?

$$ y = mx + b$$
Where, 

* y is the dependent variable,
* x is is the independent variable,
* m is the slope of the line, and
* b is the y-intercept

In terms of our variables, this becomes:
$$ WAR = m*Payroll + b $$

You probably would not surprised to find out there is a positive correlation between WAR and Payroll.  By positive, I mean that for an increase in team Payroll, there is an increase in WAR.  However, although the relationship is positive, it is not as strong as we might guess.


```{r TeamWar}
FG_TITLE_BASE <- "FANGRAPHS Leaderboard"
u <- getURL("http://www.fangraphs.com/depthcharts.aspx?position=Team")
Classes <- c("character",rep("numeric",14))
tables <- readHTMLTable(u, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, 
                        colClasses = Classes, header = TRUE, skip.rows = 1)
tables <- list.clean(tables, fun = is.null, recursive = FALSE)

WAR <- as_tibble(tables[[1]]) %>% arrange(desc(as.numeric(WAR)))
WAR$Rk = seq.int(nrow(WAR))
my_caption <- paste(FG_TITLE_BASE, "Team Combined WAR Rankings")
  knitr::kable(WAR[,c(16,1:15)], caption = my_caption)
```


\newpage


```{r BuildWAR_PayrollDB, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
c.Teams <- getCurrentTeams()
WARrf <- WAR
Sal17 <- getSalaries(2017) %>%
  mutate(Pay17 = Total.Payroll, Average = Pay17/Roster) %>%
  select(c(1,2,3,10,11)) 
Sal17$Tm <- ""

# Add Team Abbreviation to Salary tibble
for (i in 1:nrow(Sal17)){
  Sal17$Tm[i] <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team == Sal17$Team[i])$Team.Abr
}
Payroll <- select(Sal17,c(6,4))

# Add Team Abbreviation to WARrf tibble
WARrf$Tm  <- ""
WARrf$Div <- ""
WARrf$League  <- ""

WARrf <- filter(WARrf, Team != "Free Agents")

for (i in 1:nrow(WARrf)){
  WARrf$Tm[i]  <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team.Short == WARrf$Team[i])$Team.Abr
  WARrf$Div[i] <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team.Short == WARrf$Team[i])$Division
  WARrf$League[i]  <- dplyr::filter(c.Teams, Team.Short == WARrf$Team[i])$League
}

WARrf <- select(WARrf,c(18, 17, 19, 15))
combo <- merge(WARrf,Payroll) 
combo <- mutate(combo,Payroll = Pay17/1e6)
dispDat <- select(combo, c(1:4,6)) %>% arrange(desc(WAR))

```



As we showed last week, following is a table listing team WAR and Payroll values. A couple of notes:

1. The WAR values are calculated frequently by FanGraphs.  The values depicted here are different from the ones displayed last week.
2. Payroll is displayed in units of millions of dollars.


```{r}
knitr::kable(dispDat, digits = 2, caption = "MLB Teams Team Combined WAR and 2017 Payroll (Million)")
```

```{r PlotModel, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cap ="WAR versus Payroll in Millions with LM Model"}

mod <- lm(WAR ~ Payroll, data = dispDat)
modCor <- cor(dispDat$Payroll, dispDat$WAR)

my_title <- paste("Adj R2 = ", signif(summary(mod)$adj.r.squared, 5),"; Intercept =",
    signif(mod$coef[[1]],5 ), "; Slope =" , signif(mod$coef[[2]], 5),"; P=",
    signif(summary(mod)$coef[2,4], 5))
                  
ggplot(dispDat, aes(x = Payroll, y = WAR, label = Tm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = League), size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = dispDat$Tm), hjust = 1, vjust = 1) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
  ggtitle(my_title)

```

The graph above shows each MLB team's Payroll (x-axis) and Team Combined WAR (y-axis).  The red line is the linear regression model that best fits these data.  Many of the teams fall inside the 95th percentile confidence interval depicted by the shaded area.  However, many teams fall outside this confidence interval.  Most notable is the Cleveland Indians whose WAR rating is second in MLB, yet their Payroll is a **$120M less** than that of the Dodgers.  

Clearly the model is not perfect, but it does show a **relationship** between WAR and Payroll. Generally, when we increase payroll, WAR values are positively affected.

Substituting the values of the slope and intercept into our line formula, we yield the following:

$$WAR = 0.058463*Payroll + 6.6403$$
To answer our earlier question about the impact of adding $10 million dollars to the payroll, we can expect a Team Combined WAR increase of `r signif(0.058463*10.0,2)`, a small number to be sure. If the Rockies could add $100 million dollars to their payroll, we could expect an an increase of `r signif(0.058463*100.0,2)` in their Team Combined WAR.  That is an increase of `r  signif(0.058463*100.0/12*100,3)`  percent over their current WAR. 

There are many factors that go into creating a winning baseball team: good coaching, great front office, and team synergy.  Money helps, but it is expensive.


Your comments welcome.

# Colorado Rockies Dashboard
## Win Loss Margin

One of the many ways to visualize a teams performance is to show wins and losses as the margin of the win (positive) or loss (negative).  In the graphs below, we show the current season performance.  For emphasis, wins are displayed in green (above the zero) and losses in red (below).

Following the current season's graph, I have included the Win/Loss margin chart for our benchmark season of 2007 when the Rockies won the National League pennant.  

```{r GBG17}

  mutate(LossG = ifelse(grepl('L',GBG17$'W/L'),1,0))

      mutate(C.LossG = cumsum(LossG)) %>%

The Rockies current record is `r Current$Wins` Wins and `r Current$Losses` Losses.  So far, the Rockies have scored `r TotalR` runs and have had `r TotalRA` runs scored against them.

## Pythagorean Win-Loss Theorem
$$ predicted W\% = \frac{R^k}{R^k+RA^k}   $$
```{r PredWin, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Build Table of Pythagorean Win Predictions for 2017
PredictedWins <- tibble(
  `Wins (k=1.81)` = round(TotalR^1.81/(TotalR^1.81+TotalRA^1.81)*162),
  `Wins (k=1.83)` = round(TotalR^1.83/(TotalR^1.83+TotalRA^1.83)*162),
  `Wins (k=2.00)` = round(TotalR^2.00/(TotalR^2.00+TotalRA^2.00)*162))
```

Using the commonly used values of k, the Rockies predicted wins for the 2017 are shown in the table below.  Remember this statistic will vary widely over the course of the season.

# Topics for Future Articles

Here are a few suggestions, but I would prefer to hear from you, dear reader, on what interests you.

* Player Value - There is much more to cover here.  Perhaps we can rank some of the past greats based on their modern day WAR rating?
* What is the OPS+ statistic and how is it calculated.
* Survey MLB ticket prices.
* Are WAR ratings a good indicator of past season's playoff and World Series teams?
* A suggestion from a work colleague that we investigate what budding talent we have in the Rockies farm system.  I will look into this and see what I can find.

Let me know what you would like to see in future articles.  Send me an email at jdreed@q.com.

Yours truly,
